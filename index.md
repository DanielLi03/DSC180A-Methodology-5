Mentors: Nimu Sidhu and Abed El-Husseini <br>

**What is the most interesting topic covered in your domain this quarter?**  
The most interesting topic covered in my domain this quarter was learning about how different industry professionals approach safety and ethics using guardrails in generative AI. Some of the topics that were covered included profanity filters, misinformation, output consistency and hallucinations. It was interesting seeing them talk about creative solutions to these topics. <br>

**Describe a potential investigation you would like to pursue for you Quarter 2 Project.**  
An investigation I would like to pursue is seeing how I can implement a guardrail into a real world Gen AI application, such as a chatbot for a website for example. I am interested in investigating the benficial effects of implementing an effective guardrail, such test cases for profanity filtering, misinformation, as well as tricking the chat bot in revealing sensitive information. <br>

**What is a potential change youâ€™d make to the approach taken in your current Quarter 1 Project?**  
A potential change I would make to the approach taken in my current project, is exploring combinations of use cases for gen AI apps and guardrails. For example, creative text generation and explicit filtering, chat bot and misinformation, etc. <br>

**What other techniques would you be interested in using in your project?**  
A technique I would be interested in using for my project, is seeing if I can implement multiple guardrails for one gen AI application. This way, I can have multiple layers of security, rather than relying on solely one generalist guardrail to handle all the cases for me.
