**What is the most interesting topic covered in your domain this quarter?**  
The most interesting topic covered in my domain this quarter was learning about how different industry professionals approach safety and ethics using guardrails in generative AI. Some of the topics that were covered included profanity filters, misinformation, output consistency and hallucinations. It was interesting seeing them talk about creative solutions to these topics.
